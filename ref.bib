This paper uses a survey of Internet users to measure the gender divide in the contributions of cartographic information to the Internet and examine the impact of this divide within the context of OpenStreetMap and Google MapMaker. This paper argues that in both publicly available basemaps the gender divide results in men serving as the gatekeepers of local knowledge leading to gendered user-generated representations.

ABSTRACT = {OpenStreetMap (OSM), the largest Volunteered Geographic Information project in the world, is characterized both by its map as well as the active community of the millions of mappers who produce it. The discourse about participation in the OSM community largely focuses on the motivations for why members contribute map data and the resulting data quality. Recently, large corporations including Apple, Microsoft, and Facebook have been hiring editors to contribute to the OSM database. In this article, we explore the influence these corporate editors are having on the map by first considering the history of corporate involvement in the community and then analyzing historical quarterly-snapshot OSM-QA-Tiles to show where and what these corporate editors are mapping. Cumulatively, millions of corporate edits have a global footprint, but corporations vary in geographic reach, edit types, and quantity. While corporations currently have a major impact on road networks, non-corporate mappers edit more buildings and points-of-interest: representing the majority of all edits, on average. Since corporate editing represents the latest stage in the evolution of corporate involvement, we raise questions about how the OSM community&mdash;and researchers&mdash;might proceed as corporate editing grows and evolves as a mechanism for expanding the map for multiple uses.},

Yet, extreme gender participation disparities exist in which men significantly outnumber women. A central concern has been that due to self-focus bias, these disparities can lead to corresponding gender content disparities, in which content of interest to men is better represented than content of interest to women. This paper investigates the relationship between participation and content disparities in OpenStreetMap. We replicate findings that women are dramatically under-represented as OSM contributors, and observe that men and women contribute different types of content and do so about different places. However, the character of these differences confound simple narratives about self-focus bias: we find that on a proportional basis, men produced a higher proportion of contributions in feminized spaces compared to women, while women produced a higher proportion of contributions in masculinized spaces compared to men.},

On the other hand, the public has never stopped criticizing the quality of Wikipedia articles, and critics never have trouble finding low-quality Wikipedia articles. Why do Wikipedia articles vary widely in quality? We investigate the relationship between collaboration and Wikipedia article quality. We show that the quality of Wikipedia articles is not only dependent on the different types of contributors but also on how they collaborate. Based on an empirical study, we classify contributors based on their roles in editing individual Wikipedia articles. We identify various patterns of collaboration based on the provenance or, more specifically, who does what to Wikipedia articles. Our research helps identify collaboration patterns that are preferable or detrimental for article quality, thus providing insights for designing tools and mechanisms to improve the quality of Wikipedia articles.},

In doing so, we observe a geographic version of a 'born, not made' phenomenon: throughout their lifespans, contributors are relatively consistent in the places and types of places that they edit. We show how these 'born, not made' trends may help explain the urban and socioeconomic coverage biases that have been observed in OpenStreetMap.

Using a corpus of 725,000 revisions made to 2,012 pages about rules and rule discussions since 2001, we explore the dynamics of English Wikipedia’s rule-making and maintenance over time. Our analysis reveals a policy environment marked by on-going rule-making and deliberation across multiple regulatory levels more than a decade after its creation. This dynamism is however balanced by strong biases in the attention and length towards older rules coupled with a diminishing flexibility to change these rules, declining revision activity over time, and a strong shift toward deliberation. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Keegan, Brian and Fiesler, Casey}, year={2017}, month={May}, pages={112-121} }

abstract = {Current theories struggle to explain how participants in peer-production self-organize to produce high-quality knowledge in the absence of formal coordination mechanisms. The literature traditionally holds that norms, policies, and roles make coordination possible. However, peer-production is largely free from workflow constraints and most peer-production communities do not allocate or assign tasks. Yet, scholars have suggested that ordered work sequences can emerge in such settings. We refer to sequences of activities that emerge organically as components of “emergent routines.” The volunteer nature of peer-production, coupled with high degrees of turnover, makes learning and coordination difficult, calling into question the extent to which emergent routines could be ingrained in the community. The objective of this article is to characterize the work sequences that organically emerge in peer-production, as well as to understand the temporal dynamics of these emergent routine components. We center our empirical investigation on the peer-production of a set of 1,000 Wikipedia articles. Using a dataset of labeled wiki work, we employ Variable-Length Markov Chains (VLMC) to identify sequences of activities exhibiting structural dependence, cluster the sequences to identify components of emergent routines, and then track their prevalence over time. We find that work is organized according to several routine components, and that the prevalence of these components changes over time.},

Recent studies have established that the organizational structure of such communities is not flat; rather, participants can take on a variety of well-defined functional roles. What is the nature of functional roles? How have they evolved? And how do participants assume these functions? Prior studies focused primarily on participants' activities, rather than functional roles. Further, extant conceptualizations of role transitions in production communities, such as the Reader to Leader framework, emphasize a single dimension: organizational power, overlooking distinctions between functions. In contrast, in this paper we empirically study the nature and structure of functional roles within Wikipedia, seeking to validate existing theoretical frameworks. The analysis sheds new light on the nature of functional roles, revealing the intricate "career paths" resulting from participants' role transitions.},

abstract = {Abstract Traditionally, OpenStreetMap (OSM) has been recognized as a volunteered geographic information (VGI) project. In recent years, many corporations have enlisted teams of mappers to edit data on OSM. These teams of corporate editors (CEs) can quickly edit large swaths of data using a variety of methods. Consequently, there are new tensions over possible community bifurcations where editing and map stewardship disagreements may occur between the CEs and non-CEs. To characterize CE and non-CE editing interactions, we focused on six locations with varied types of corporate editing activity. We created six temporal (2015–2020) editing networks for each location, resulting in 36 total networks. We found a continual increase in the number of editors, with more growth in places with CEs. There was significant co-editing between the two groups, with CEs showing more in-group editing patterns, both in terms of number of edits and time between edits. We conclude that currently the CE and the non-CE communities continue to co-exist and co-produce open geospatial data in apparent harmony, even though the size of the CE community and volume of contributions have grown significantly. Finally, we discuss implications for OSM as a VGI project in light of our corporate editing trends.},

abstract = {Roles provide a key coordination mechanism in peer-production. Whereas one stream in the literature has focused on the structural responsibilities associated with roles, another has stressed the emergent nature of work. To date, these streams have proceeded largely in parallel. In seeking to enhance our understanding of the tension between structure and agency in peer-production, we investigated the interplay between structural and emergent roles. Our study explored the breadth of structural roles in Wikipedia (English version) and their linkage to various forms of activities. Our analyses show that despite the latitude in selecting their mode of participation, participants' structural and emergent roles are tightly coupled. Our discussion highlights that: (a) participants often stay close to the “production ground floor” despite the assignment into structural roles; and (b) there are typical modifications in activity patterns associated with role-assignment, namely: functional specialization, multispecialization, defunctionalization, changes in communication patterns, management of identity, and role definition. We contribute to theory of coordination and roles, as well as provide some practical implications.},

abstract = {Research on peer-production suggests that as participants choose what actions to perform, prototypical activity patterns emerge. Recent work characterized these patterns and demonstrated that informal emergent roles are highly stable. Nonetheless, we know little about the ways in which contributors take on and shed emergent roles. The objectives of this study are to: (a) delineate the temporal dynamics of participants' emergent role taking behaviors, and (b) identify the motivations driving role-transition behaviors. Our study links motivation to role-transition behaviors within Wikipedia. Our first sample covered eleven years and 222,119 contributors, and was used to identify four categories of temporal role-taking behaviors, that differ in their mobility between emergent roles and across Wikipedia articles. Our second examination linked the motivations of 175 new participants to their subsequent role-taking activity over 14 months. Together, the two analyses reveal that role-taking categories can be distinguished based on participants' motivational orientation (intrinsic/extrinsic and self/others-oriented).},

ABSTRACT = {For the last few years, the increasing need for humanitarian support has led to increasing demand and responsibilities for the international humanitarian system. This trend raises questions regarding the use of alternative and complementary data sources and potential additional actors and communities that could be involved in support efforts and cover some of the tasks of humanitarian organizations. The article provides an overview of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, their practices and activities as well as current needs and challenges. The article illustrates the potential of OpenStreetMap and digital volunteers for humanitarian activities, with a particular focus on disaster risk reduction in the scope of the Missing Maps project. The background and objective of the collaborative project as well as its potential and impact for the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement are elucidated. The conclusion and outlook section presents future plans and visions to make further use of the potential of the Missing Maps approach in additional sectors and contexts.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed much work unraveling human mobility patterns through urban visitation and location check-in data. Traditionally, user visitation and check-in have been assumed as the same behavior, yet this fundamental assumption can be questionable and lacks supporting evidence. In this paper, we seek to understand the similarities and differences of visitation and check-in by presenting a large-scale systematic analysis under the specific setting of urban revisitation and re-check-in, which demonstrate people's periodic behaviors and regularities. Leveraging a localization dataset to model urban revisitation and a Foursqaure dataset to delineate re-check-in, we identify features concerning POI visitation patterns, POI background information, user visitation patterns, user preference and users' behavioral characteristics to understand their effects on urban revisitation and re-check-in. We examine the relationship between revisitation/re-check-in rate and the features we identify, highlighting the similarities and differences between urban revisitation and re-check-in. We demonstrate the prediction effectiveness of the identified characteristics utilizing machine learning models, with an overall ROC AUC of 0.92 for urban revisitation and 0.82 for re-check-in, respectively. This study has important research implications, including improved modeling of human mobility and better understanding of human behavior, and sheds light on designing novel ubiquitous computing applications.},

abstract = {It is often observed that the majority of the development work of an Open Source Software (OSS) project is contributed by a core team, i.e., a small subset of the pool of active devel- opers. In fact, recent work has found that core development teams follow the Pareto principle — roughly 80\% of the code contributions are produced by 20\% of the active developers. However, those findings are based on samples of between one and nine studied systems. In this paper, we revisit prior studies about core developers using 2,496 projects hosted on GitHub. We find that even when we vary the heuristic for detecting core developers, and when we control for system size, team size, and project age: (1) the Pareto principle does not seem to apply for 40\%-87\% of GitHub projects; and (2) more than 88\% of GitHub projects have fewer than 16 core developers. Moreover, we find that when we control for the quantity of contributions, bug fixing accounts for a similar proportion of the contributions of both core (18\%-20\%) and non-core developers (21\%-22\%). Our findings suggest that the Pareto principle is not compatible with the core teams of many GitHub projects. In fact, several of the studied GitHub projects are susceptible to the “bus factor,” where the impact of a core developer leaving would be quite harmful.},
